# WebScrapper
Educational Python/Selenium scraper that collects degree and course data from a configurable university-style site. Uses a config file (not committed) and saves results to JSON in /outputs. Includes BeautifulSoup parsing, headless Chrome setup, and sample structure. Designed for coursework and portfolios; real URLs and data stay local.
